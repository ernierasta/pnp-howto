# How to use gutter fold layout

## Prepare:

* **steel ruler** (not aluminium)
* **crafting knife**
* sticky photo paper **OR** normal photo (or linen) paper and glue stick
* **card stock** 130-260 (adjust to thickness of photo paper and lacquer)
* optionally - **transparent acrylic lacquer** (car lacquer works good)

## Howto:

1. Print all pages.
2. *Optionally* cover them with lacquer.
3. Using ruler and back of your knife make a dent on central folding line, so it will be easier to fold.
4. Fold paper.
5. Glue card stock on the bottom part of the page **2-3mm** from folding line.
6. Glue upper part of paper by folding it.
7. Cut longer lines first, but only from cutting mark to cutting mark, never cut whole page.
8. Cut shorter lines.

Done!
