# Inkscape - automatic layout and components creation

## Overview

While **Inkscape** itself could help a lot with game designing tasks, when combined with extensions dedicated for board games creation you will get one of best tools you could ever use to create your layouts in minutes! In this tutorial we will not only generate layouts, but also create cards, which uses as much vector graphics as possible and use raster images only as illustration. 

In next tutorial we will take already created raster (for example in png format) components and arrange them on the page.(TODO)

Goal of this how-to is to take our components and generate all layouts and files we need.

----------------------------------------------------------

**Note**: You may wonder if this is best approach to automation, there are other tools dedicated to creating cards (or maybe other components). Choice is yours, but here is why I think this is the best combination:

 * **Inkscape** is open source, forever free, amazing vector designing program which will be there next 50 years. ;-)
 * **countersheetsextension** is open source, forever free, advanced tool, dedicated to board games creation. It is written by **Pelle Nilsson** board game designer who understand how it should work, it has many advanced features and good documentation. Github commits starts in 2010 which means there is **more then 10 years of development**.
 * This is multiplatform solution, so works on **Linux**, **MacOS** and **Windows**.
 * It is universal, you need **tokens**, **cards**, **dices**, **standies**, ... you can create/arrange them all using the same tools.
 * It is **easy**, but **powerful**. You can start quick and small, but tool allows you to set many options if you need them. It will grow with you.
 * **You are in control**. After you generate components - you will get ordinary **svg file**, which you can edit as you like. This allows you to customize output as you want it to be, even if extension doesn't (yet) do exactly what you need.
 * **Automatic PDF generation**.

## Why every game creator should use automation?

I really believe, that everyone should automatically generate their layouts and components. Here are reasons why:

 * **Easy iterative changes.** Fix typo, change icon, click twice, done. New version ready to release (in multiple layouts).
 * **Quick experiments and easy cooperation.** Do you want to try new graphic element? Change it, click and check out all your components.
 * **Much faster workflow.** After following this tutorial you will create your games much faster!
 * **Easy translation.** All texts are in one file editable with Libreoffice Calc or MS Excel.
 * **Professional output** Automation allows you create and maintain multiple layouts for different styles of game builds without additional work.

## Software used

* **Inkscape** - core of all our work.
* **countersheetsextension** - Inkscape extension.
* **Libreoffice Calc** - to manipulate csv files. You can use **MS Excel** or any other editor you want, but all info here is for **Calc**.

## Before reading

For **Inkscape** I would recommend to read **Before reading** section in [previous Inkscape tutorial](gutter-foud-without-template.md) if you are not familiar with Inkscape.
For **countersheetsextension** installation go to [official wiki](https://github.com/lifelike/countersheetsextension/wiki/Install). Just install it (copy to extension folder) and go back here.
For **Libreoffice**, just go to [official site](https://www.libreoffice.org/) to download it, or install it as you normally install your programs (package manager).

## How automation works?

We will have our layout and our components design in svg file. We will use data entered in spreadsheet to generate final svg file. We will also have other graphic files with parts of our design, which will be embedded into main layout svg file. After we generate everything, we will export it into pdf.

## Preparing components

Let's create card. Open **Inkscape**, in **File - Document properties ...** make sure we have **A4** **portrait** set (to not worry we will take care of US Letter later).

With **Rectangle tool** [**R**] create rectangle of any size. Open **Fill and stroke** panel [**CTRL+SHIFT+F**], on **Stroke style** tab switch to **millimeters** and set **Width** to **0.001**. On **Stroke** tab set color to black and on **Fill** tab click on **cross** to disable fill. Press [**S**] to switch to **Select and transform tool** and in toolbar switch to **millimeters** set width to **63.5** and height to **88.9** ([**Enter**] will confirm value) - those are poker card dimensions. Move our card out of page if it is on it.

Now press [**CTRL+D**] to duplicate rectangle, on the bottom color toolbar click on some color, f.e: red(#FF0000). This will be our card border at the end, we will change it's color for different cards. Hold **SHIFT** and click on bottom color toolbar on X to disable stoke. To open **Transform** panel press [**CRTL+SHIFT+M**] switch to **Scale** tab and add bleed by adding 2mm on all sides, so switch to **mm** and set width to **67.5**, height to **92.9** and hit **Apply**. Then send this rectangle to the bottom by pressing [**End**]. Open Object panel by pressing [**CTRL+SHIFT+O**] and change ID to "border" and click **Set** (I will explain it later). 

Press [**Tab**] to switch to our previous rectangle (or click on it when zoomed in). Change ID to "card" and click **Set**.

Press [**CTRL+D**] to duplicate rectangle, click on 2.5% gray (#F9F9F9FF) and then hold **Shift** and click on X symbol on bottom color toolbar. Press [**CTRL+SHIFT+M**] and on **Scale** tab click on **Clear**, set **mm** and width to **53.5** and height **78.9**. This is our card main area.

Now with **Rectangle tool** [**R**] create some rectangle next to our card (but not on it), with **Select tool** [**S**] set it to 3mm x 3mm. Set color to f.e. green (#abc837ff). Press [**CTRL+D**] to duplicate, drag duplicated square down, click on it to get rotation handles, hold [**CTRL**] drag corner to rotate by 3 "jumps", so it will be rotated by 45Â°. Change color to orange (#FF6600). Create circle [**E**], make it blue () with no stroke (**Shift** and click on X) and [**S**] to set size to 3x3 millimeters. Press [**SHIFT+8**] for **Stars and polygons tool**, in toolbar set **Regular polygon** and **3** corners. Draw triangle holding **CTRL** (bottom should be horizontal), on toolbar click on **lock** icon (between width an height) and set width to **4.243mm**, change color to pink (#FF2A7FFF).


Press [**CTRL+SHIFT+O**] click on all 4 symbols one by one and name them **ssquare**, **sdiamond**, **scircle**, **striangle**, do not forget to press **Set** every time you write it to **ID** box.

_**NOTE**: as it is easy to get lost in object names, I am using convention, where all objects which serve the same function, in other words - will be placed on component on the same spot - are prefixed with the same letter(-s). 
<br>In this case, all symbols are prefixed with "s"._

Select green rectangle and make clone of it by **Edit - Clone - Create clone** [**ALT+D**], shortcut may not work under Linux. Open **Object properties** [**CTRL+SHIFT+O**] and set **ID** to **symbol**, press **Set**. Enable snapping [**%**] if not already enabled and make sure you have **Snap to cusp nodes, incl. rectangle corners** enabled. Take clone and snap it to the left upper corner of the card, to the left upper corner of the "card" rectangle (real card size without bleed). Press [**CTRL+SHIFT+M**] to open transform panel and on **Move** tab make sure **Relative move** is checked, set horizontal to **0.5** and vertical to **5.0**, press **Apply**. Switch to **Text tool**, click somewhere out of anything, write **2** and set font and size (I've used **Dejavu Sans Mono** and **8** size). Press [**CTRL+SHIFT+O**], set **ID** to **number** press **Set** button. Switch to **Select tool** and holding **Shift** click on clone (so number 2 and cloned image is selected), press [**CTRL+SHIFT+A**], set **Relative to** to **Last selected** and click on **Center on vertical axis** and **Center on horizontal axis**.

It is good moment to save our template. Let's name it _tutorial.svg_ (but name doesn't matter).

**Let's download some graphics.**

All images are public domain and do not require attribution. I am not sure, that direct download links will not change if so, I had download images in original size.

* [The fast young woman](https://www.flickr.com/photos/britishlibrary/11039936684/in/gallery-148737994@N08-72157684640978966/) [(direct download)](https://live.staticflickr.com/5527/11039936684_4479b24c1e_o_d.jpg)
* [The viscountess wear'em](https://www.flickr.com/photos/britishlibrary/11039896135/in/gallery-148737994@N08-72157684640978966/) [(direct download)](https://live.staticflickr.com/2873/11039896135_1239d1d6df_o_d.jpg)
* [The widow](https://www.flickr.com/photos/britishlibrary/11038075323/in/gallery-148737994@N08-72157684640978966/) [(direct download)](https://live.staticflickr.com/7374/11038075323_091029b3c0_o_d.jpg)

Save those images in **images** subdirectory (create it where _tutorial.svg_ file is). To simplify filenames, rename files to **img1.jpg**, **img2.jpg**, **img3.jpg** (for this tutorial it is not important which is which).

In Inkscape in **File - Import...** and select **images/img1.jpg**, select **Link** in the dialog (if dialog will not show up, enable it in **Edit - Preferences - Imported images - Ask about linking and scalling when importing bitmap images**).  Switch to select tool [**S**], lock ratio change (lock icon between width and height settings on toolbar) and set height to 78.5. Select card main area (it 2.5% gray). Press [**CTRL+D**] to duplicate it. Then holding **SHIFT** select also imported image, press [**CTRL+SHIFT+A**] and **Align top edges** and **Center on vertical exes**. Go to menu **Object - Clip - Set**. [**CTRL+SHIFT+O**], name it "img" and press **Set**. Center image vertically and horizontally to the gray card main area (it will cover it entirely).

To create text press [**T**] and click somewhere. Write "Card title" and [**CTRL+SHIFT+O**] to set ID to "text". You should pick some font and size on text toolbar(a have **Dejavu Sans Mono** size **16**) also set **Text alignment** to **centered**. Select created text and image with select tool and [**CTRL+SHIFT+A**] to **Center on vertical axis** and **Align top edges**. Select only image. Press [**CTRL+SHIFT+M**] and on Move tab set Vertical to 2 mm and press **Apply**.

Now finish designing the card by selecting all elements creating card (click left and higher of the left-top corner and release to the right and under bottom-right corner) and press [**CTRL+G**] to group all objects to one group. This is necessary!

Save our template.

## Creating csv file

While there is many ways how you can create CSV file in this tutorial we will use Libreoffice Calc, which is spreadsheet module of this open source office suite. After starting Calc, we will create table header. Header determines what we want to "clone" or change.

When creating our card template, we were naming certain parts of our design, to be able to manipulate them easily. Let's recapitulate. In our template we defined:

  * **card** - rectangle sized to our card size (in this example poker card size),
  * **border** - rectangle which creates bleed and thick border which is part of our card design,
  * **symbol** - symbol under the number, will be replaced by:
     * ssquare
     * sdiamond
     * scircle
     * striangle
  * **number** - it is text, card number
  * **img** - image covering whole card main are
  * **text** - card title text

Let's define our header. On the first row place following values (each in separate column)

|@card|symbol|number|img|text|border[style:fill]|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

First column is special, it is always component template name (rectangle defining component size, grouped with other elements of that component template). You can see **@** in front of name, that creates our cards without actual card rectangle visible. We do not want to have black lines around cards.
Another special header is last one - **border[style:fill]**, you recognize **border**, this is our border around cards main area.We want to change fill color of it, so that is why **[style:fill]** is there, there could be **[style:stroke]** if we would like to change stroke color. NOTE: style changes must be placed as last columns.

Now lets create our first card!

|@card|symbol|number|img|text|border[style:fill]|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | ssquare | 1 | img1.jpg | Young woman | red |

You may wonder, what nr **1** in first column means - it is number of components to generate. Do you need 3 the same cards? Put 3 in there. 
In second column we put ID of object we want to use there and since we prefixed our names with **s** we know it is something that replaces our **symbol** object.
In last column I used **red** as color, you can also use hex value (**#00FF00**).

## Special object names

### Special layers:

**cs_layout** layer - when named **cs_layout** layer will dictate space availabile for components. Every rectangle will be used as place for components. Bleed doesnt count as occupied space.

**cs_background_front** layer - this layer will be added to all pages containing components fronts. You can use it to add additional elements or cutting helpers to the page.

**cs_background_back** layer - this layer will be added to all pages containing components backs.

All three layers supports suffixes, so instead **cs_layout** you can have **cs_layout_mysuffix**(where **mysuffix** is suffix entered in plugin configuration).


### Special objects


**cs_regstyle** line - 
**cs_foldstyle** line - 

## CSV Cheatsheet

There may be **multiple** tables in one csv file! Just leave **one empty line** between tables. 
**ID** means **object ID** in Inkscape, which is set after **[CTRL+SHIFT+O]**.

column1 header  | column2 header
----------------|----------------
column1 value 1 | column2 value 1
column1 value 2 | column2 value 2

**"x"** below means object ID , not literal x!

Special **header** symbols:
 
 * **first column header** - is always template ID.  
 * **@x** - hide template defining rectangle. Used very often. 
 * **BACK** - if you name column like that, it will mean, that component have a back. There must be **y** as value in column.
 * **+** - by default back use the same template as front,if you name column simply **'+'** you can define different template for backs. Put **x** or **@x** as value, where **x** is ID of template. 
 * **partx*** or ***partx** - means wildcard. **partx** means part of object ID. Values in this column will change multiple objects, like **x1**, **x2**, **xten** or in second case **1x**, **2x**, **tenx**.
 * **x[style:fill]** or **x[style:stroke]** - allows to set **fill** or **stroke** color for element called **x**. You can set also: **stroke-width** and many others. You can find more in [spreadsheetextension wiki](https://github.com/lifelike/countersheetsextension/wiki/Set-Style). You can also use this header to copy style of other object (value in column must be \<id), [more](https://github.com/lifelike/countersheetsextension/wiki/Copy-Style). **WARNING: currently color changes must best be last rows in csv (components must be generated first to be changed).**

Special **column** values:

 * **number in first column** - how many of this components will be generated. You can also use **number+**(fill whole row with tokens), **number++** fill entire box, **number+++** current page. **number** determines minimal ammount, f.e. **3++** creates at least 3 components and continues creating them until they fill whole box (rectangle in **cs_layout** layer).
 * **=somevalue** - set default value for this column. Default is used if there is no value given for this row.
 * **\<x** - combined with header **x[style:x]** copies given style from **\<x** object.
 * **@x** - hide template defining rectangle.
 * **<<filename.txt** - read given text file.
 * **\*bold*** and **_/italics/_** - use **star**(\*) to make text **bold** and **slash**(/) to make text _italics_.
 * **{filename.png}** - place image inside text.
 * **%autonumber%** - if you put **%autonumber%** into text, it will be replaced by number (automatic sequence 1,2,3,...).
